# Progressive Containerization Strategy

Follow the "start small, build as needed" philosophy for Docker setup:

## 1. Start Minimal

Begin with the absolute minimum:
- Single container with just your app
- Minimal Dockerfile (5-10 lines)
- No orchestration unless multiple services
- Build with --no-cache to prevent issues

Use templates:
- `dockerfile-minimal` - Basic single-stage
- `docker-compose-minimal.yml` - Single service

## 2. Assess Actual Needs

Only add complexity when you need it:
- Database: When persistent storage required
- Cache: When performance measured as slow  
- Multi-stage: When image size exceeds 500MB
- Networks: When security isolation needed
- Volumes: When data must persist

## 3. Progressive Enhancement Path

```
Minimal App → Add Database → Add Cache → Optimize Build
     ↓             ↓              ↓            ↓
dockerfile-   docker-compose- docker-compose- dockerfile-
minimal       with-db.yml    with-cache.yml  multistage
```

## 4. Cache Prevention for Frontend

ALWAYS prevent cache issues in frontend builds:
```bash
# Required for all frontend builds
docker build --no-cache -t myapp .

# Or use the provided script
./scripts/build-no-cache.sh myapp
```

## 5. Decision Framework

Before adding anything ask:
1. Is the app working without it?
2. What specific problem does this solve?
3. Can I defer this addition?
4. What's the simplest solution?

## 6. Templates by Progression

1. **Starting Out**
   - `dockerfile-minimal`
   - `docker-compose-minimal.yml`

2. **Adding Persistence**
   - `docker-compose-with-db.yml`

3. **Adding Performance**
   - `docker-compose-with-cache.yml`

4. **Optimizing Builds**
   - `dockerfile-multistage`
   - `dockerfile-frontend-*` (with cache prevention)

## Output Requirements

Based on project stage, provide ONLY:
1. Minimal working Dockerfile
2. docker-compose.yml only if multiple services
3. .dockerignore for efficiency
4. Build script enforcing --no-cache
5. Next steps when actually needed

Remember: Complexity is easy to add, hard to remove. Start minimal!
