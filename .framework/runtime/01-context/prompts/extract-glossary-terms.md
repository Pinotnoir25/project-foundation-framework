# Extract Glossary Terms Prompt

## First Check: Does the project need a glossary?
Before creating `glossary.md`:
- Are there domain-specific terms being used?
- Is there potential confusion about terminology?
- Are business concepts being defined?
- Do API resources have special meanings?

If no to all, don't create a glossary. Standard technical terms don't need documentation.

## When building or updating the glossary:

## 1. Term Identification
Scan project materials for:
- Domain-specific terminology
- Business concepts and entities
- Technical acronyms used
- API resources and operations
- User roles and permissions
- Project-specific conventions

## 2. Term Categories
Classify terms by type:
- **Business Terms**: Domain concepts, business rules
- **Technical Terms**: Technologies, patterns, acronyms
- **API Terms**: Endpoints, resources, operations
- **User Terms**: Roles, permissions, actions
- **Data Terms**: Models, entities, relationships

## 3. Definition Requirements
For each term, provide:
- Clear, concise definition
- Context of usage in this project
- Examples if helpful
- Related or similar terms
- Source or authority if applicable

## 4. Extraction Sources
Review these materials:
- PRDs for business terminology
- Technical specs for system terms
- API documentation for interface terms
- User stories for role definitions
- Code comments for conventions
- Meeting notes for agreed terminology

## 5. Glossary Maintenance
Consider:
- Terms that have evolved in meaning
- Deprecated terms to mark as obsolete
- New terms introduced by features
- Ambiguous terms needing clarification
- Terms with multiple meanings in different contexts

## Quality Checks
- Avoid circular definitions
- Use plain language where possible
- Include pronunciation for acronyms
- Provide concrete examples
- Link to authoritative sources
- Keep definitions current with usage
