# [Database] Connection Manager PRD

**Status**: Draft  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Reviewers**: [Team Members]

## Executive Summary

The [Database] Connection Manager is a critical infrastructure component that enables the [Your Application] to establish and maintain secure connections to the [Database Type] database. This feature provides reliable, performant, and secure database access for all [Domain] operations while handling connection pooling, retry logic, and monitoring.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem
The [Application] needs to access a [Database Type] database with [specific requirements]. Without a robust connection management system, we face:
- Connection instability leading to failed operations
- Security vulnerabilities from improper connection management
- Performance issues from inefficient connection pooling
- Difficulty monitoring and debugging connection issues

### Impact of Not Solving
- Failed [operations] due to database unavailability (estimated X% failure rate)
- Security audit failures from improper access patterns
- Poor user experience with slow or failed operations
- Inability to scale beyond [current limit] concurrent users

### Evidence
- Industry best practices require connection pooling for production database access
- Security requirements mandate [security approach] for [data type]
- Similar systems report X% performance improvement with proper connection management

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Establish reliable [Database] connections
2. Implement efficient connection pooling
3. Provide comprehensive connection monitoring

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Connection Success Rate | N/A | 99.9% | Connection logs |
| Average Connection Time | N/A | <Xms | Performance monitoring |
| Connection Pool Efficiency | N/A | X% reuse | Pool statistics |
| Failed Operations Due to Connection | N/A | <X% | Error tracking |

### Non-Goals
- [List what this feature will NOT do]
- Supporting multiple database backends (initially)
- Implementing custom protocols

## Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Implement a connection manager that:
1. Establishes secure database connections
2. Maintains a pool of reusable connections
3. Handles automatic retry and recovery
4. Provides health monitoring endpoints

### Key Features
1. **Connection Management**
   - Description: Automatic connection creation and lifecycle management
   - Benefit: Reliable database access
   - Priority: P0

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Description: Reusable connection pool with configurable size
   - Benefit: Improved performance and resource efficiency
   - Priority: P0

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Description: Real-time connection status and metrics
   - Benefit: Proactive issue detection and debugging
   - Priority: P1

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------------|----------|-------------------|
| FR1 | Establish secure connection to [Database] | P0 | Connection succeeds within X seconds |
| FR2 | Implement connection pooling (min X, max Y) | P0 | Pool maintains connections efficiently |
| FR3 | Auto-retry failed connections (X attempts) | P0 | Connections retry with exponential backoff |
| FR4 | Provide connection health endpoint | P1 | Returns status within Xms |
| FR5 | Log all connection events | P1 | Structured logs with correlation IDs |
