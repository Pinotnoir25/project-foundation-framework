# Framework Documentation

This directory contains materials intended for **human learning and reference**. These files help developers understand the framework's concepts, best practices, and see complete examples.

## Directory Structure

### `/guides/`
Educational content explaining concepts, standards, and best practices:
- **System Guides**: How to use the framework's systems (PRDs, tasks, context management)
- **Technical Guides**: Best practices for architecture, security, testing, etc.

### `/examples/`
Complete reference implementations showing the framework in action:
- **PRD Examples**: Well-structured product requirement documents
- **Task Examples**: Properly broken down task lists
- **Project Examples**: Full projects using the framework

## How to Use

1. **New to the framework?** Start with guides to understand concepts
2. **Need a reference?** Check examples for real implementations
3. **Setting standards?** Review technical guides for best practices

## Note for Claude

While Claude may reference these materials for understanding framework philosophy, the primary runtime instructions are in the `/runtime/` directory. These documentation files are optimized for human comprehension.
