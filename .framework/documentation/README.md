# Framework Documentation

This directory contains materials intended for **human learning and reference**. These files help developers understand the framework's concepts, best practices, and see complete examples.

## Directory Structure

### `/guides/`
Educational content explaining the framework, numbered in recommended reading order:
1. **01-getting-started.md** - Framework philosophy and core principles
2. **02-managing-context.md** - How to maintain project context across conversations
3. **03-writing-prds.md** - Creating effective product requirement documents
4. **04-technical-documentation.md** - Writing technical specifications
5. **05-task-management.md** - Breaking down work into manageable tasks

### `/examples/`
Complete reference implementations showing the framework in action:
- **PRD Examples**: Well-structured product requirement documents
- **Task Examples**: Properly broken down task lists

## How to Use

1. **New to the framework?** Read the guides in numbered order (01 through 05)
2. **Need a reference?** Check examples for real implementations
3. **Quick reminder?** Jump to the specific guide you need

## Reading Path

For the best understanding:
1. Start with `01-getting-started.md` to understand the framework philosophy
2. Learn context management before creating any documentation
3. Master PRDs before moving to technical specs
4. Understand the full flow before diving into task management

## Note for Claude

While Claude may reference these materials for understanding framework philosophy, the primary runtime instructions are in the `/runtime/` directory. These documentation files are optimized for human comprehension.
