and create tasks using docs/tasks/prompts/prd-to-tasks.md
```

### Step 2: Review Generated Tasks
Tasks will be saved to: `docs/tasks/features/[category]/[feature]-tasks.md`

### Step 3: Estimate Tasks
```
@claude Please estimate tasks in [feature]-tasks.md using 
docs/tasks/prompts/estimate-tasks.md
```

### Step 4: Plan Sprints
```

# Get blocked
@claude Mark task T1.1.2 as "Blocked" - waiting on [dependency]
```

### Status Checks

## Best Practices

1. **One task at a time**: Focus on single task completion
2. **Update immediately**: Don't batch status updates
3. **Track actual time**: Help improve estimates
4. **Document blockers**: Include what you tried
5. **Small commits**: One commit per task when possible
