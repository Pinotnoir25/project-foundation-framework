### 2. Domain Mapping (`domain-mapping.md`)

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Start with Project Setup**: Always begin with the project setup prompt
2. **Follow the Flow**: Each prompt builds on previous information
3. **Be Specific**: The more detail you provide, the better the framework can assist
4. **Iterate**: You can always return to update information

## Quick Start

Copy and paste this to Claude to begin:
```

## Best Practices
