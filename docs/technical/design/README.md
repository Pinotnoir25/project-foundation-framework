# Technical Design Documentation

This directory contains technical design decisions and implementation patterns for features.

## Structure

Each design document corresponds to a feature or technical component and includes:
- Technical decisions made
- Rationale for choices
- Implementation patterns
- Usage examples

## Naming Convention

Files should be named after the feature they implement:
- `authentication.md` - Auth system design
- `file-uploads.md` - File upload design
- `api-gateway.md` - API gateway design

## Creating New Designs

Use the template at `.framework/runtime/03-technical/templates/technical-design-template.md`

## Workflow

1. PRD defines business requirements
2. Technical questions arise during implementation
3. Decisions are documented here
4. Patterns are included for reuse
5. Tasks reference these designs
