## Executive Summary

The MongoDB Connection Manager is a critical infrastructure component that enables the MCP server to establish and maintain secure connections to the Research MongoDB database through SSH tunnels. This feature provides reliable, performant, and secure database access for all CMP metadata operations while handling connection pooling, retry logic, and monitoring.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem
The MCP server needs to access a MongoDB database that is only accessible via SSH tunnel for security reasons. Without a robust connection management system, we face:
- Connection instability leading to failed operations
- Security vulnerabilities from improper tunnel management
- Performance issues from inefficient connection pooling
- Difficulty monitoring and debugging connection issues

### Impact of Not Solving
- Failed LLM queries due to database unavailability (estimated 15-20% failure rate)
- Security audit failures from improper access patterns
- Poor user experience with slow or failed operations
- Inability to scale beyond 10-20 concurrent users

### Evidence
- Industry best practices require connection pooling for production database access
- Security requirements mandate SSH tunnel access for healthcare data
- Similar systems report 40% performance improvement with proper connection management

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Establish reliable MongoDB connections via SSH tunnel
2. Implement efficient connection pooling
3. Provide comprehensive connection monitoring

### Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Connection Success Rate | N/A | 99.9% | Connection logs |
| Average Connection Time | N/A | <100ms | Performance monitoring |
| Connection Pool Efficiency | N/A | 80% reuse | Pool statistics |
| Failed Operations Due to Connection | N/A | <0.1% | Error tracking |

### Non-Goals
- Direct MongoDB connection without SSH tunnel
- Supporting multiple database backends
- Implementing custom SSH tunnel protocol

## User Personas & Use Cases

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Nexus LLM making queries about CMP metadata
- **Secondary**: System administrators monitoring connection health

### User Journey
Current: No systematic connection management
Future: Automated, reliable connection establishment with transparent retry and monitoring

### Use Cases
1. **Basic Query Execution**
   - **Actor**: Nexus LLM
   - **Scenario**: LLM needs to query user permissions
   - **Expected Outcome**: Query executes within 200ms with automatic connection handling

2. **Connection Recovery**
   - **Actor**: System
   - **Scenario**: SSH tunnel drops during operation
   - **Expected Outcome**: Automatic reconnection within 5 seconds, queued operations resume

## Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Implement a connection manager that:
1. Establishes SSH tunnels on demand
2. Maintains a pool of MongoDB connections
3. Handles automatic retry and recovery
4. Provides health monitoring endpoints

### Key Features
1. **SSH Tunnel Management**
   - Description: Automatic tunnel creation and lifecycle management
   - Benefit: Secure, reliable database access
   - Priority: P0

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Description: Reusable connection pool with configurable size
   - Benefit: Improved performance and resource efficiency
   - Priority: P0

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Description: Real-time connection status and metrics
   - Benefit: Proactive issue detection and debugging
   - Priority: P1

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|------------|----------|-------------------|
| FR1 | Establish SSH tunnel to MongoDB | P0 | Tunnel connects within 5 seconds |
| FR2 | Implement connection pooling (min 5, max 20) | P0 | Pool maintains connections efficiently |
| FR3 | Auto-retry failed connections (3 attempts) | P0 | Connections retry with exponential backoff |
| FR4 | Provide connection health endpoint | P1 | Returns status within 50ms |
| FR5 | Log all connection events | P1 | Structured logs with correlation IDs |

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Connection establishment <100ms after tunnel ready
- **Security**: All connections encrypted, credentials never logged
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, automatic recovery

### Technical Constraints
- Must use SSH key authentication (no passwords)
- MongoDB version 4.4+ compatibility required
- Node.js/Python runtime environment

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- SSH client library (e.g., ssh2 for Node.js)
- MongoDB driver with connection pooling support
- Environment configuration for SSH and MongoDB credentials

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| SSH tunnel instability | Medium | High | Implement automatic reconnection with backoff |
| Connection pool exhaustion | Low | High | Queue overflow requests, add monitoring alerts |
| Credential exposure | Low | Critical | Use environment variables, never log secrets |

## Timeline & Milestones

### Phases
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Basic SSH tunnel and MongoDB connection
2. **Phase 2** (Week 2): Connection pooling implementation
3. **Phase 3** (Week 3): Monitoring and error handling
4. **MVP**: Week 3 - Stable connections with basic monitoring
5. **Full Release**: Week 4 - All features with comprehensive testing

### Release Criteria
- [ ] All P0 requirements implemented
- [ ] Testing coverage > 80%
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review passed

## Open Questions

1. Should we support multiple MongoDB clusters?
2. What's the preferred monitoring integration (Prometheus, CloudWatch, etc.)?
3. Should connection credentials be rotated automatically?
