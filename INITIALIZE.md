# Welcome to Your Project Foundation Framework

## Getting Started

Welcome! This framework provides a structured approach to project documentation and task management, designed to work seamlessly with Claude AI. Whether you're building a web application, API service, data platform, or any other software project, this framework will help you maintain clarity and consistency throughout your development process.

### First Steps

1. **Initialize Your Project Context**
   ```
   @claude initialize new project
   ```
   This will guide you through setting up your project's context and core documentation.

2. **Define Your Project**
   - Project name and description
   - Technical stack and architecture
   - Key stakeholders and users
   - Core objectives and success metrics

3. **Explore the Framework**
   - `/docs/prd/` - Product Requirements Documentation system
   - `/docs/tasks/` - Task management and tracking
   - `/docs/initialization/` - Setup prompts and guides
   - `/.project/` - Project context and conversation history

### Quick Commands

- `@claude show project status` - View current project context
- `@claude create PRD for [feature]` - Start documenting a new feature
- `@claude plan sprint` - Organize tasks into actionable sprints
- `@claude update context` - Save current conversation context

### Framework Philosophy

This framework emphasizes:
- **Context Persistence**: Your project details are preserved across conversations
- **Structured Documentation**: PRDs and tasks follow consistent templates
- **Conversational Workflow**: Natural language interactions with Claude
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

### Next Steps

Run the initialization prompt to begin:
```
@claude I want to initialize a new project. Please guide me through the setup process.
```

The system will help you:
1. Create your project profile
2. Set up initial documentation
3. Configure your development workflow
4. Establish success metrics

Remember: This framework adapts to YOUR project needs. Use what helps, modify what doesn't, and build something amazing!
