# Framework Examples

This directory contains real-world examples of projects built using the Project Foundation Framework. Each example demonstrates how to adapt the framework for different types of projects.

## Available Examples

### 1. MongoDB MCP Server (`/mongodb-mcp-server/`)
A healthcare data integration project showing:
- Complex technical requirements (SSH tunnels, security)
- Regulatory compliance needs
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Domain-specific terminology

**Key Lessons**:
- How to handle sensitive data requirements in PRDs
- Security-first task planning
- Compliance documentation integration

### 2. E-Commerce Platform (Coming Soon)
Will demonstrate:
- Consumer-facing application patterns
- Payment integration requirements
- Inventory management complexity
- Multi-channel deployment

### 3. SaaS Dashboard (Coming Soon)
Will showcase:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Subscription management
- Analytics and reporting
- API-first design

## How to Use Examples

1. **Study the Structure**: See how each example organizes its documentation
2. **Review Customizations**: Note project-specific adaptations
3. **Copy Patterns**: Reuse relevant sections for your project
4. **Learn from Decisions**: Understand the rationale behind choices

## Creating Your Own Example

After successfully using the framework, consider contributing your example:

1. Create a new directory under `/examples/`
2. Include:
   - Customized CLAUDE.md
   - Sample PRDs
   - Task breakdowns
   - Key decisions made
3. Add a README explaining your use case
4. Document lessons learned

## Common Patterns Across Examples

### Technical Patterns
- Connection management for external services
- Authentication and authorization approaches
- Data validation and error handling
- Monitoring and observability

### Documentation Patterns
- Executive summaries that sell the "why"
- Clear success metrics tied to business value
- Realistic timeline estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies

### Task Management Patterns
- Foundation → Implementation → Testing flow
- Dependency management between tasks
- Sprint boundaries based on deliverables
- Buffer time for unknowns
